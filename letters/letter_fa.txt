Greetings everyone,

To all distinguished guests, enthusiastic delegates, and dedicated advisors,

It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the fourteenth annual <span class="glowy">TISBMUN</span> conference as the Model United Nations coordinator of The International School Bangalore. I am both honoured and humbled as I welcome you all and look forward to the opportunity to guide and support you all through this enriching and transformative experience.

TISBMUN XXIV is scheduled from 14th to 16th December; during this time we will gather in the spirit of cooperation and collaboration to address some of the most pressing issues facing our global community. Through thoughtful debate, innovative problem-solving, and a dedication to understanding multiple perspectives, we will seek solutions that will impact not only our simulated world but, hopefully, our real one as well.

The world is shrinking; today we cannot stay isolated from the problems faced by any country anywhere in the world. It calls upon us to recognize that the challenges we face do not respect borders, and neither should our solutions. We must rise above division, working hand in hand to find common ground and create a brighter future for all. As students and young learners, in your discussions and debate lies the opportunity to find solutions to the challenges we face in the world today. I sincerely hope that some of these discussions on historical or created situations will stir your minds and create thought processes that you will find stimulating and applicable to some future challenges you might face one day.

We are looking to continue the success of TISBMUN over the last decade, while bringing in creative and innovative committees. While there are exclusive committees for senior and junior students, some mix committees will give students the opportunity compete within a wider age group. This year, we are looking forward to building on the experience earned while continuing the shining legacy that our predecessors entrust with us.

To our delegates, I challenge you to come forward with courage and determination. Step into the shoes of world leaders, diplomats, and advocates. Embrace this opportunity to learn, to grow, and to make your voices heard. Remember that while you may represent a particular nation, you also bear the responsibility of considering the broader global interest.

Advisors, your guidance and mentorship are invaluable to the success of this conference. Your role in shaping the minds of these future leaders is immeasurable, and we are grateful for your dedication to their growth and development.

I offer you my assurance that our team is working to create the highest quality content and delegate experience, supervised by TISB staff. We look forward to hosting you and providing you a MUN experience, second to none!

Regards,
Sumita Tambi
